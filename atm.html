        <p>This project was good because it taught me about java script. I am proud of it because I advanced my skills in java script and learned the basic of making a video game. One thing difficult was one of the levels it took about two days to work on. Some things I could have changed was kept on going on to finish all the levels and being able to create the final project which would have been a video game.</p>

        <p>This is my favorite project because I got to design a food and a city scape. I am proud of it because it one of it was one of the first projects I did in illustrator and I believe that it looks really good for a beginner. Some of the difficult things in the process is the icing on the doughnut, I would like to redo do it on the right side of the doughnut. </p>

        <p>This project was fun to do because it was a group project. I am proud of it because I learned how to put in exentsions into sketchup. Some of the things that were difficult in this process was learning all the skills and remebering were the key shortcuts are for the tools. </p>
