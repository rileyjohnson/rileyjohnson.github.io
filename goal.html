        <h2>COLLEGE</h2>
        <p>Personally I not thinking about college right now I'm just trying to get through middle school.
           It's in four years so I have some time. If I had to go to a college it would be Cal Berkeley.
           Cal Berkeley is a good engineering school for the price and is not as hard to get in than these other schools.

        <p>With my life I would love too work for small companie that has a meaning. I would also like to live on a bus or on the road touring the place I will be living at or just have a tiny house or stuido apartment.
           My dream job would to be a marine corps and be a scout sniper instead of assulter. However thats something my family wouldn'y want me to do.
